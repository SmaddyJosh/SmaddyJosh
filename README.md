- Hi there! I'm Josh, a passionate Computer Science student . I love building real-world tech solutions and exploring how code can transform ideas into apps that people actually use.

🔧 What I do:

 Python developer with hands-on experience building cross-platform apps using Kivy

 Web developer skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — I enjoy creating responsive, user-friendly websites

 Constantly learning and experimenting with new tools, libraries, and frameworks

 Currently diving deeper into mobile development and embedded systems using Java, Arduino and Kotlin

 I enjoy solving problems, working on creative projects, and contributing to tech communities. Check out my pinned projects to see what I've been building!
